# Task 2.3: Implement Auth Guard

**Task ID:** 2.3  
**Date and Time:** Completed during authentication implementation  
**Status:** âœ… Completed  

## Task Description
Create a new script `admin/js/auth-guard.js` to protect admin pages using `onAuthStateChanged` to check if a user is logged in, and redirect to `index.html` if not authenticated.

## What Was Accomplished
- Created `admin/js/auth-guard.js` script for authentication protection
- Implemented `onAuthStateChanged` listener to monitor authentication state
- Added automatic redirect to `index.html` for unauthenticated users
- Included auth-guard script in all HTML files inside the `admin/` directory
- Integrated with existing authentication system

## Files Modified
- **Created:** `admin/js/auth-guard.js`
- **Modified:** `admin/dashboard.html` (script inclusion)
- **Modified:** `admin/admin-profile.html` (script inclusion)
- **Modified:** `admin/quiz-manager.html` (script inclusion)
- **Modified:** `admin/scores.html` (script inclusion)
- **Modified:** `admin/users.html` (script inclusion)

## Code Changes Summary
- Created authentication state monitoring system
- Implemented automatic redirect logic for unauthenticated users
- Added script inclusion to all admin pages
- Integrated with Firebase authentication system
- Ensured proper script loading order

## Challenges Encountered
- Managing authentication state changes and redirect timing
- Ensuring auth guard loads before other scripts that depend on authentication
- Handling edge cases where user authentication state is unclear

## Testing Notes

- Unauthenticated users are properly redirected to login page
- Authenticated users can access admin pages without issues
- Authentication state changes are properly handled

## Next Steps

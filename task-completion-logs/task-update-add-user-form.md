# Update Add User Form to Match Groupmate's Data Structure

**Task ID/Name:** update-add-user-form  
**Date and Time:** Completed now  
**Status:** âœ… Completed

## Task Description
Update the "Add User" modal in the user management interface to match the data structure used by the groupmate, ensuring consistency across the application.

## What Was Accomplished
- Updated the Add User modal form fields to match the groupmate's data structure
- Modified the JavaScript code to save data in the correct format
- Enhanced the user details view to display all relevant fields

## Files Modified
- **Modified:** `admin/users.html` (Add User modal form)
- **Modified:** `admin/js/users.js` (form handling and data saving)

## Form Field Changes

### Before (Admin Panel Format):
- Name (text)
- Email (email)
- Status (active/inactive)

### After (Groupmate's Format):
- Username (text) - maps to `UsernameData`
- Email (email) - maps to `EmailData`
- Credentials (select) - maps to `Credentials`
- Status (select) - maps to `Status`
- Password (password) - maps to `PasswordData`

## Data Structure Mapping
When a new user is created, the data is saved as:
```json
{
  "UsernameData": "username",
  "EmailData": "email@example.com",
  "Credentials": "Independent",
  "Status": "Logged Out",
  "PasswordData": "password",
  "progress": 0,
  "joinDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## Status Options
- Logged Out
- Logged In
- Active
- Inactive

## Credentials Options
- Independent
- Student
- Teacher
- Admin

## Security Note
The password field is included to match the current data structure, but this should be removed in production. Passwords should be handled through Firebase Authentication instead of storing them in the Realtime Database.

## Testing
- Add User form now includes all fields matching the groupmate's structure
- New users are saved with the correct field names
- User details modal displays all relevant information
- Form validation works for all required fields

## Next Steps
- Coordinate with groupmate to remove password storage from database
- Implement Firebase Authentication for user login
- Consider standardizing the data structure across the entire application
